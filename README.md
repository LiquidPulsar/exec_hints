# exec_hints
Pretty comprehensive typehint evaluator to give you code that extra bit of zazz and illegibility it always needed.


For all examples, here's the obvious prerequisite:
```py
from exec_hints import exec_hints, check_hints, _UnionType, Literal
```
Alternatively, you can just `import exec_hints` and use the module as a callable!


Let's start off small: you can specify a hint on an argument and it'll convert it:
```py
@exec_hints
def foo(arg:int):
    print(arg*arg)

foo('12')
>>> 144
```

```py
@exec_hints
def foo(arg:set):
    print(arg, arg.issubset('123'))

foo('12')
>>> {'2', '1'} True
```

```py
@exec_hints
def foo(arg:set[int]):
    print(arg, arg.issubset(range(10)))

foo('12')
>>> {1, 2} True
```
A single argument to `dict` will modify all values, two arguments means the first applies to keys and the second to values:
```py
@exec_hints
def foo(arg:dict[int]):
    print(arg, arg.keys())

foo({'a':'123',12:13.2})
>>> {'a': 123, 12: 13} dict_keys(['a', 12])
```
Works with `Union`s (more on that later):
```py
@exec_hints
def foo(arg:set[int|str]):
    print(arg, arg.issubset(range(10)))

foo('1a2')
>>> {1, 'a', 2} False
```
If an iterable hint is provided with a number of arguments matching what was passed, each subhint will be applied to corresponding arguments:
```py
@exec_hints
def foo(arg:list[int,str,int]):
    print(arg, arg[::-1])

foo('1a2')
>>> [1, 'a', 2] [2, 'a', 1]
```
...and of course, we can nest these ðŸ˜Ž:
```py
@exec_hints
def foo(arg:list[int,int|str,tuple[int|float|str]]):
    print(arg)

foo(('1','a',['1','2.67','b']))
>>> [1, 'a', (1, 2.67, 'b')]
```
If several options are given, it tries each in turn:
```py
@exec_hints
def foo(arg:list[int,int|str]|tuple[int|float|str]):
    print(arg)

#first fails because there are 2 subhints and 3 args provided
foo(['1','2.67','b'])
>>> (1, 2.67, 'b')
#first works!
foo(['1','2.67'])
>>> [1, '2.67']
```
You can pass your own functions in here but they can't directly be used with `|`.
Blame Python, not me.
```py
@exec_hints
def foo(arg:lambda x: x[::2]):
    print(arg)

foo('banana')
>>> bnn
```
There's a workaround for that tho!
`list|1` isnt supported by Python, so we have a class for that: `Literal`
which accepts a callable or a literal (ok, the class name isnt the best; accepting any suggestions).
If it's callable, it will try to call it, otherwise will just return itself:
```py
@exec_hints
def foo(arg:int|Literal(0)):
    print(arg)

foo('banana')
>>> 0
```
We can use it to chain builtins that wouldnt normally be allowed.
Also, note you can use it with `[]` syntax too:
```py
@exec_hints
def foo(arg:int|Literal[str.upper]):
    print(arg)

foo('banana')
>>> BANANA
```
This documentation would have to be a few miles long to cover all of this,
so here's a few examples:
```py
@exec_hints
def foo(message:int|tuple[int]|list[0], dct:dict[int,tuple[str.lower]]):
    print(message)
    print(dct)

foo('a1',{'213':'BaNaNa','444':'BoBa'})
>>> [0, 0]
>>> {213: ('b', 'a', 'n', 'a', 'n', 'a'), 444: ('b', 'o', 'b', 'a')}
```
Uhh, it works on a lot of stuff :)
Notably you can manipulate `*args` and `**kwargs` as normal.
Works with defaults too, but it will try to apply the hint to the default provided:
```py
@exec_hints
def a(a,b:str.upper,c:tuple[int],d=12,*e:lambda x:map(str,x),f:int|Literal(-3)=3,**g:dict[str]):
    print(a,b,c,d,e,f,g)

a(1,'bb',['2','3'],4,5,banana=1,apple=2)
>>> 1 BB (2, 3) 4 ('5',) 3 {'banana': '1', 'apple': '2'}
```
You can typehint return values too ðŸŽ‰!
```py
@exec_hints
def foo(arg:int|Literal(str.upper)) -> lambda x:tuple(reversed(x)):
    print(arg)
    return arg

print(foo('banana'))
>>> BANANA
>>> ('A', 'N', 'A', 'N', 'A', 'B')
```

Works with classes, including dataclasses. As of 0.1.4 it's a bit scuffed as the result is a function that calls the constructor of the class, but it works.
```py
import exec_hints
from dataclasses import dataclass

@exec_hints
@dataclass
class Bot:
    alignment: bool
    serial: int
    name: str


print(Bot(123123, '12', 2))
>>> Bot(alignment=True, serial=12, name='2')
```

The `check_hints` function is useful for debugging or making sure your hints are correct. Works as you would expect it to similar to `exec_hints`, but will raise an error if the hint fails. Literal checks are also done via equality, or if the literal is callable, it will be called on the arg and checked for truthiness.
```py
from exec_hints import check_hints

@check_hints
def foo(arg:int|Literal(str.upper)):
    print(arg)

foo('banana') # FAILS
foo('BANANA') # PASSES
```
